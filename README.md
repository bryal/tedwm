# TedWM: A combined Text Editor and Window Manager for developers

**EARLY WIP**

TedWM is (going to be) a window manager powered by a powerful text editor,
much like [EXWM/Emacs](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm), targeted at developers.

Typical desktop environments, like Gnome or KDE, may feel to restrictive and heavy to certain users.
With limited customizability, optimizing your workflow can be tricky.

Composing your own environment, on the other hand, i.e. combining some arbitrary window manager
with an application launcher, text editor, terminal, etc., are likely to entail many
pain points, due to the fragmented and stand-alone nature of the tools in the ecosystem.

Introducing TedWM.
Aimed at developers who wish for a unified, integrated desktop environment experience
without the bloat of a typical desktop environment, while still retaining absolute
customizability. TedWM combines a window manager with a text-editor and a terminal emulator.
All assets of the environment are configurable and fully programmable through a common scripting language.
